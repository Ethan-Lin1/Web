    What is this Game?
  </h2>
<p>This game is a trading card game designed for younger children, but it is usually played by adults.
This is because of the compelxity of the game. With over 10000 different cards, it might be hard to choose were to start. Essentially, it is game
were there are 3 types of cards: monsters, spells, and traps. Monsters are cards you can summon and attack with. Spells are cards you can activate generally on your
turn and they will have effects. Traps are cards that you can activate on any turn except the turn you set them to your field. Essentially, this game is a game of 
trying to win by removing all of your opponents lifepoints, using monsters, spells, and traps to help you win, seems simple enough right? This is until you realize that there
are many different effects that interact with each other to form combos which essentially end on boards of multiple monsters that have coveted negate effects
that can negate an effect your opponent activates. Pair this with a card called handtrap which is a monster that activates in the hand to negate or interupt your opponent
on there turn, and then things start getting out of hand. However, there are many other ways to play the game and many other aspects that are critical to know. 
Honestly, it takes a PHd to understand it all.</p>

<h2> My experience </h2>
<p>I first started this game in 2017 while I was a middle schooler in 7th Grade. I would play yugioh with my friends in my lunch table and we would play every lunch whethere
  we won or lost. It really didn't matter to us. Basically, we would have 7 way games with 7 players and just attack, team up, or betray each other. It was a vicious cycle of winning
  , losing, and waiting for your turn while hoping to live. I will admit, some of our yugioh decks, something I forgot to mention before, were much better than the other's.
  Essentially, a yugioh deck is 40-60 cards of monsters, spells, and traps. Obviously, some cards were better than others and some cards had better synergy than others making them overall
  better deck. But that hierachy of decks didn't matter to me back then. Fast forward to 2020, I started to pick up the game again. Now, however, I wanted to be more competitive and play against the best of the game
  . I had to face off against those who new the in's and out's of the games and all the decks. I tried pretty hard to learn the meta, what the best decks were, and learn how to play the game
  . I will admit; it wasn't the easiest feat, but eventually I became somewhat affluent and played in a decent number of local tournaments and gained quite a bit of friends through yugioh. Finally, 
  I signed up for something big. I played in a 256-person tournament and after 10 grueling hours, I got 33rd place. Amazing! With this, I could call myself a decent player. And yeah, that's my yugioh experience so far.
