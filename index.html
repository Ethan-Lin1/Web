    What is this Game?
  </h2>
<p>This game is a trading card game designed for younger children, but it is usually played by adults.
This is because of the compelxity of the game. With over 10000 different cards, it might be hard to choose were to start. Essentially, it is game
were there are 3 types of cards: monsters, spells, and traps. Monsters are cards you can summon and attack with. Spells are cards you can activate generally on your
turn and they will have effects. Traps are cards that you can activate on any turn except the turn you set them to your field. Essentially, this game is a game of 
trying to win by removing all of your opponents lifepoints, using monsters, spells, and traps to help you win, seems simple enough right? This is until you realize that there
are many different effects that interact with each other to form combos which essentially end on boards of multiple monsters that have coveted negate effects
that can negate an effect your opponent activates. Pair this with a card called handtrap which is a monster that activates in the hand to negate or interupt your opponent
on there turn, and then things start getting out of hand. However, there are many other ways to play the game and many other aspects that are critical to know. 
Honestly, it takes a PHd to understand it all.</p>
